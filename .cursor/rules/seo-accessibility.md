## SEO

- Unique, descriptive titles and meta descriptions
- One H1 per page (derived from `title`); start headings at H2 in content
- Use absolute internal links; avoid duplicate content
- Image filenames should be descriptive and keyword-relevant

## Accessibility

- Provide meaningful `alt` text in Russian for images
- Use clear link text; avoid "click here"
- Keep step instructions sequential and scannable
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (use theme defaults)
